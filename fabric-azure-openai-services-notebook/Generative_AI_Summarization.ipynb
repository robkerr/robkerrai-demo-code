I have bought 2 sets. One from a local bike shop in spring of 2015 and one recently on amazon. Both times one tire had a defective sidewall that made a bubble and was unsafe for use. The defective one I received most recently wouldn't even stay on the rim when inflated and failed in dramatic fashion as it was inflated, blowing off the rim and violently popping the inner tube. The bulge spot was that bad. Upon closer inspection I noticed the tire rim lip was delaminated and of uneven consistency in that spot and the side wall was thinner and wavy than the rest of the tire. One defective product can always happen to any company, but 2 defective tires out of 2 sets!!!!!! Come on.... The set i've had on my main road bike for 8 months now performs amazingly and even in the glass and metal littered wasteland that is downtown Portland, i've never gotten a flat. This is the only reason they get 2 stars. The fact is however, i'll never feel safe on these things as I will always wonder if the the tires on my bike will eventually fail in the same way, but while i'm riding it. Reading other reviews on Amazon I believe this is a common enough issue that this concern is valid and i'm probably going to switch tires. I wish Schwalbe would fix this issue as these could be amazing tires, but my conclusion is that they are too much risk and trouble to bother with.

Tried again, and again. My brother the mountain biker wanted a shot, no joy the tires wont stay on. Took them to REI and the mechanic there fussed and bent and fitted them on the ring - he said he had never worked with more difficult tires than the Schwalbe. So now I have paid to have them mounted but I'm probably going to yank them off - whats the point to a tire where ANY loss of pressure means you have to go to a shop and ask for their most experieced guy to finesse these stupid tires back onto the rims.

These shifters are great quality and shift well. HOWEVER, the 3 speed shifter will get stuck/locked on the 1 speed if you shift downwards in 1 speed. This can be temporarily fixed by unbolting the plastic plate on top and moving over the paw upwards which frees the system. Then it will allow it to shift up to 3 and back down properly. The defect is when you shift down from 1 speed because it will get stuck there. This is a major product defect because you will often shift down many times to ensure you use all the clicks on a bike ride. These are promising shifters/brake levers, but since I bought two, and they had the same issue, they are defective in that sense. It may be possible to loosen a bolt in there to make it to where it doesn't get stuck into that position. For now, that is the only temporary fix if you plan on never accidentally shifting down from 1 which is nearly impossible.

These shifters are great quality and shift well. HOWEVER, the 3 speed shifter will get stuck/locked on the 1 speed if you shift downwards in 1 speed. This can be temporarily fixed by unbolting the plastic plate on top and moving over the paw upwards which frees the system. Then it will allow it to shift up to 3 and back down properly. The defect is when you shift down from 1 speed because it will get stuck there. This is a major product defect because you will often shift down many times to ensure you use all the clicks on a bike ride. These are promising shifters/brake levers, but since I bought two, and they had the same issue, they are defective in that sense. It may be possible to loosen a bolt in there to make it to where it doesn't get stuck into that position. For now, that is the only temporary fix if you plan on never accidentally shifting down from 1 which is nearly impossible. If you are looking into buying shifters, the best 3x7 speed shifters I've bought are sunrace triggers shifters or MicroShift 3x7 grip shifters."],["DMAIP 2Pcs Professional EF51-7 3x7/8 21/24Speed MTB Bicycle Bike Left Right Brake Lever Shifter Set","As others have indicated, very easy installation.

I have bought 2 sets. One from a local bike shop in spring of 2015 and one recently on amazon. Both times one tire had a defective sidewall that made a bubble and was unsafe for use. The defective one I received most recently wouldn't even stay on the rim when inflated and failed in dramatic fashion as it was inflated, blowing off the rim and violently popping the inner tube. The bulge spot was that bad. Upon closer inspection I noticed the tire rim lip was delaminated and of uneven consistency in that spot and the side wall was thinner and wavy than the rest of the tire. One defective product can always happen to any company, but 2 defective tires out of 2 sets!!!!!! Come on.... The set i've had on my main road bike for 8 months now performs amazingly and even in the glass and metal littered wasteland that is downtown Portland, i've never gotten a flat. This is the only reason they get 2 stars. The fact is however, i'll never feel safe on these things as I will always wonder if the the tires on my bike will eventually fail in the same way, but while i'm riding it. Reading other reviews on Amazon I believe this is a common enough issue that this concern is valid and i'm probably going to switch tires.
